# multithreaded-webserver
The project is a Java-based client-server communication application, featuring both single-threaded and multithreaded implementations, along with a thread pool-based server.

The application allows clients to connect to the server, send a "Hello" message, and receive a response.

The multithreaded implementations enable handling multiple client connections concurrently, while the thread pool-based server improves scalability and resource management.

The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Java, including networking, concurrency, and error handling.
